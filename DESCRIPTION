Description: A comprehensive set of functions providing frequentist methods for network meta-analysis and supporting Schwarzer et al. (2015), Chapter 8 "Network Meta-Analysis":
 - frequentist network meta-analysis following Rücker (2012);
 - net heat plot and design-based decomposition of Cochran's Q (Krahn et al., 2013);
 - measures characterizing the flow of evidence between two treatments (König et al., 2013);
 - ranking of treatments (frequentist analogue of SUCRA);
 - automated drawing of network graphs.
